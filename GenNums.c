#define ARRAYLEN 200

//In this program I do a few different things. I read in a number from the keyboard to set my seed for my random number generator. I then use that seed to generate a random number between 10 to 200 which will determind the SIZE of my array. Then I go ahead an initialize an array, myArray, with random generated integers between 0 and 1000. In here I also show how I would write to a file if I need to later.
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{

	int myArray[ARRAYLEN];
	int i;

	//Declaring the variable for seed
	int seed;
	char myFileName[20];

	//This is where the program takes in the command line. "argv[1] will be the second argument read in from the command line which is going to be a number that will be used as the seed for the random number generator
	sscanf(argv[1], "%d", &seed);

	//This is where I will be using the seed read in from the command line and plugging it into srand to seed the random number generator
	srandom(seed);

	//This is where I will generate a random number between 10 to 200 (there are two ways to do this!!)
	//int r is our random number generated between 10 to 200 to initiliaze my array
	int r = random()%(190+1)+10;

	//200 is max, 10 is min
	//int r = rand()%(200-10+1)+10;

	//This is where I will initialize myArray with random numbers from 0 to 1000 with size r
	for(i=0; i<r; i++)
	{
		myArray[i] = random()%(1000+1);
		//fprintf(stdout, "%d\n", myArray[i]);
	}

	// Declare pointer to the file
	FILE *ofp;

	//Create my file name that I want data written to
	char outputFilename[] = "myFileName";

	//In order to open a file, use the function fopen(), I am also going to use "w" because I am writing to this file
	ofp= fopen(outputFilename, "w");


	//This is where I will be writing the random generated values of my array into my file 
	for(i=0; i<r; i++)
	{
		int c;
		c = myArray[i];
		fprintf(ofp, "%d\n", myArray[i]);
		printf("%d\n", myArray[i]);
